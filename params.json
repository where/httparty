By default\r\nit will output the response as a pretty-printed Ruby object (useful for\r\ngrokking the structure of output). This can also be overridden to output\r\nformatted XML or JSON. Execute `httparty --help` for all the\r\noptions. Below is an example of how easy it is.\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttparty \"http://twitter.com/statuses/public_timeline.json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Help and Docs\r\n\r\n* https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/httparty-gem\r\n* http://rdoc.info/projects/jnunemaker/httparty\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n* Fork the project.\r\n* Make your feature addition or bug fix.\r\n* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.\r\n* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself in another branch so I can ignore when I pull)\r\n* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.\r\n","name":"HTTParty"}
